Unforunately openprocessing locks the camera libraries behind a paywall. You can however copy/paste the code into your Processing sketchpad.

Mouseclick on the active video feed to select a color. Whichever point in the video feed is closest to the selected color will create bouyant star objects. Click again to re-select.
